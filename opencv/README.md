# OpenCV library build for esp-idf
This project used to build and include OpenCV library into the esp-idf as a component for esp32, esp32s2 and esp32s3 CPUs.
Now the opencv could be build with IDF version 4.4. 
This component was tested with opencv V 4.6.0
The build is working only on Linux machines.
