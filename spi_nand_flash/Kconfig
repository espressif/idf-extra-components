    config NAND_FLASH_VERIFY_WRITE
        bool "Verify SPI NAND flash writes"
        default n
        help
            If this option is enabled, any time SPI NAND flash is written then the data will be read
            back and verified. This can catch hardware problems with SPI NAND flash, or flash which
            was not erased before verification.

    config NAND_FLASH_ENABLE_BDL
        bool "Enable Block Device Layer (BDL) support"
        default n
        help
            Enable Block Device Layer (BDL) support for SPI NAND Flash. This provides:
            - Standard esp_blockdev_t interface for layered architecture
            - Flash Block Device Layer (raw NAND flash access)
            - Wear-Leveling Block Device Layer (logical sector access with wear leveling)
            - Advanced layered API (spi_nand_flash_init_with_layers)
            When disabled, only the legacy API is available.

    config NAND_ENABLE_STATS
        bool "Host test statistics enabled"
        depends on IDF_TARGET_LINUX
        default n
        help
            This option enables gathering host test statistics and SPI NAND flash wear levelling simulation.
