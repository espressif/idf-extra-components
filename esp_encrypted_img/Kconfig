            Select the cryptographic scheme to use for pre-encrypted Over-The-Air updates.

                Use RSA for encrypting the GCM key.
                The device will decrypt the GCM key using its private RSA key.

            select MBEDTLS_HKDF_C
            bool "ECIES encryption"
            help
                Use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for key agreement.
                The GCM key will be derived using ECDH with a server public key
                and a device private key (potentially derived via HMAC).
