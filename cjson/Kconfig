    config CJSON_NESTING_LIMIT
        int "Maximum nesting depth for JSON parsing"
        default 1000
        help
            Limits how deeply nested arrays/objects can be before cJSON
            rejects to parse them. This is to prevent stack overflows.
            Lower values use less stack, higher values allow deeper nesting.

    config CJSON_CIRCULAR_LIMIT
        int "Maximum depth for circular reference detection"
        default 10000
        help
            Limits the depth for circular reference detection during
            printing/comparison operations. This prevents infinite loops
            and stack overflows when processing JSON structures with
            circular references. Lower values use less stack.
