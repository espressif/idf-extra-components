    config ESP_SCHEDULE_ENABLE_DAYLIGHT
        bool "Enable Daylight (Sunrise/Sunset) Schedules"
        default y
        help
            Enable support for sunrise and sunset based schedules.

            This feature allows scheduling based on astronomical calculations
            for sunrise and sunset times at specific geographical locations.

            Disabling this option will:
            - Remove sunrise/sunset schedule types from the API
            - Save memory by excluding solar calculation code
            - Reduce binary size (by about 11500 bytes)

            If disabled, ESP_SCHEDULE_TYPE_SUNRISE and ESP_SCHEDULE_TYPE_SUNSET
            will not be available.

    config ESP_SCHEDULE_ENABLE_CRON_EXPR
        bool "Enable cron expression schedules"
        default n
        help
            Enable support for cron-like expressions (e.g. "0 9 * * *")
            to define recurring schedules. Disable this to save code/heap
            if cron-based scheduling is not needed.
